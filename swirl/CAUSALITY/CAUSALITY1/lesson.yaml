## Conceptual Questions
# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Suppose a variable is binary, that is, it takes on values of either 0 or 1 (for example, female gender). Which of the following is the same as its sample mean?'
  AnswerChoices: 'the sample median; the sample rate of 1''s; neither of these'
  CorrectAnswer: the sample rate of 1's
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "the sample rate of 1's")
  Hint: 'Think about the formula for the mean.'

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What kind of value is "FALSE"?'
  AnswerChoices: '"character"; "logical"; "binary"; "numeric"'
  CorrectAnswer: logical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = '"logical"')
  Hint: 'See ''Subsetting the Data in R''.'

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Translate the following statement using R`s logical values (i.e., "TRUE" and "FALSE") and operators (i.e., !, =, &, and |): True or false is not false.'
  CorrectAnswer: TRUE | FALSE == !FALSE
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("TRUE | FALSE == !FALSE", "TRUE | FALSE != FALSE", "(TRUE | FALSE) != FALSE")
  Hint: 'See ''Subsetting the Data in R'' (and be sure you use proper capitalization and spacing!).'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In order to calculate the mean of a variable we have used the "length()" function in the denominator. The "length()" of a vector is equivalent to ________'
  AnswerChoices: 'the number of elements; the height; the maximum'
  CorrectAnswer: the number of elements
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'the number of elements')
  Hint: See 'Subsetting'

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'True or False: A factor variable is another name for a categorical variable.'
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: 'True'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'True')
  Hint: 'See ''Subsetting the Data in R''.'

## Programming questions
- Class: text
  Output: 'A variety of external data files can be loaded into R, such as tables with comma separated values (or CSV''s) and R Workspace files (RData files).' 
 
# Question 1
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Using the read.csv() function, we have pre-loaded the external data file "resume.csv" as an object called "resume". Call the head() function to look at the first six rows of "resume".'
  CorrectAnswer: head(resume)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "head(resume)")
  Hint: 'See ''Data Files'' in Chapter 1.'

# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Find the dimensions of "resume".'
  CorrectAnswer: dim(resume)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dim(resume)")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'This question has two parts. First, create a summary of "resume" that contains, along with other information, the sample means of each variable in "resume".'
  CorrectAnswer: summary(resume)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "summary(resume)")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What was the callback rate in the data? In other words, about what percent of the fictitious applicants received a call back?'
  AnswerChoices: '2%; 16%; 8%; 9%'
  CorrectAnswer: 8%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "8%")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: '"resume" contains two binary variables, "sex" and "call". Create a table that compares the number of female applicants to the number of male applicants who did and did not receive a call back. Be sure to label the rows as ''sex'' and the columns as ''call''.'
  CorrectAnswer: table(sex = resume$sex, call = resume$call)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "table(sex = resume$sex, call = resume$call)")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'
