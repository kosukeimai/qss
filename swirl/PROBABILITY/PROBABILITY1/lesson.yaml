# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'I roll a fair 6-sided die 3,000,000 times. The number 1 turns up approximately 500,000 times, so I conclude that the probability of a 1 is 1/6. This is the ___ approach to probability.'
  AnswerChoices: '"Frequentist"; "Bayesian"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Frequentist'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"Frequentist"')
  Hint: See 6.1.1.

# Question 2
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Suppose that P(A)=0.4 and P(B)=0.3. What is the minimum value of P(A and not B)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.1'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.1')
  Hint: See the Law of Total Probability. What happens if B is entirely contained in A?

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Out of all possible anagrams for the word CHAIR (including the original word), what is the probability that the letter I comes first?'
  AnswerChoices: '0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.2')
  Hint: See 6.1.3.

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which of these is NOT the numerator of a correct use of Bayes Rule and/or the definition of conditional probability, for P(A | B, C)?'
  AnswerChoices: 'P(B | A, C) P(A | C); P(B, C | A) P(A); P(A, B, C); P(A, B | C) P(C)'
  CorrectAnswer: 'P(A, B | C) P(C)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(A, B | C) P(C)')
  Hint: See 6.2.3.

# Question 5
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'A disease affects 1% of the population. The only test for the disease returns positive 99% of the time the disease is actually there, though it returns positive 20% of the time if the disease is not actually there. You take this test and it returns positive. What is the probability you have the disease (rounded to nearest 0.01)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.05'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.05')
  Hint: See Section 6.2 on Conditional Probability.

# Question 6
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What was the conditional independence assumption we made in our race + surname example?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Once we know the race of the individual, we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.; Once we know the probabilities of the predictor variables we can assume that the race of the individual is independent.; Once we know the probability of the race we can assume the probabilities of the predictor variables are independent.'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Once we know the label of the output variable we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"Once we know the label of the output variable we can assume that the predictor variables are independent."')
  Hint: See 6.3.2.

# Question 7
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Let A and B be two independent variables that take on only the values 0 and 1. If P(A=1, B=1)=0.12, P(A=0, B=1)=0.28, and P(A=1)=0.3, what is P(A=0, B=0)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.42'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.42')
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 8
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'There are three prisoners: A, B, & C. One prisoner, selected uniformly at random, will be pardoned while the other two will be executed. Prisoner A asks the jailer (who knows) to tell him one of the prisoners who will be executed: "If I will be pardoned, just flip a coin and tell me B or C; if C will be pardoned, tell me B; and if B will be pardoned, tell me C." The jailer says B will be executed. Using Bayes Rule, what is the numerator of the expression evaluating the probability that C is pardoned?'
  AnswerChoices: 'P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned); P(B is executed | C is pardoned) * P(B is executed); P(C is pardoned | jailer says B is executed) * P(B is executed)'
  CorrectAnswer: 'P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned)')
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 9
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Based on the previous question, What is the probability of C being pardoned (express to the nearest 0.01)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.67'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.67')
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 10
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'You have a bucket with 2 coins: one is a regular coin, while the other has heads on both sides. You pick a coin at random and flip it: it turns up heads. What is the probability you chose the fair coin (express to the nearest 0.01)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.33'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.33')
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 11
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Suppose again, you have that bucket with 2 coins, one a regular coin and the other w/heads on both sides. You pick a coin at random. If at any point you get a tails, you obviously picked the fair coin. If you keep getting heads, you stop & decide it is the unfair coin, but only if the probability you picked the fair coin is less than 1/1000, otherwise you keep flipping. What is the minimum number of times you must flip heads in a row before you can decide it is indeed the unfair coin?'
  CorrectAnswer: '10'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='10')
  Hint: See 6.2.2.
