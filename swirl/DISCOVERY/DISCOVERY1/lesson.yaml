## Conceptual Questions
- Class: text
  Output: 'These exercises are a companion to Chapter 5 of ''A First Course in Quantitative Social Science''. When you see ..., press Enter.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Chapter 5 introduces many concepts related to discovery, one of which is ''unsupervised learning''.'

# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What is an example of an ''unsupervised learning'' problem?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Finding topics in a set of newspaper articles; Discovering ideological differences among legislators; Identifying commonly used words in an author''s corpus; All of these'
  CorrectAnswer: All of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "All of these")
  Hint: See Chapter 5. 

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'How did unsupervised learning enable researchers to address the disputed authorship of the Federalist Papers?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Hamilton and Madison preferred to discuss different topics; Hamilton and Madison favored different words to describe the same thing; Madison left coded messages in his prose; All of these'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Hamilton and Madison preferred to discuss different topics'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Hamilton and Madison preferred to discuss different topics')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What kind of information does a document-term matrix like "dtm" contain?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Term frequencies across a set of documents; The number of times a word is used in a document; The number of documents that contain a word at least once; All of these'
  CorrectAnswer: All of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "All of these")
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Why does working with a document-term matrix requires us to make the ''bag-of-words'' assumption?'
  AnswerChoices: 'A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words; A document-term matrix contains a lot of words; A document-term matrix sorts similar words into bags; None of these'
  CorrectAnswer: A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which of these do you think best describes the topic of the eighth Federalist Paper?'
  AnswerChoices: 'The costs and benefits of standing militia; Trade between the colonies; The universal rights of man; The abolition of slavery'
  CorrectAnswer: The costs and benefits of standing militia
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "The costs and benefits of standing militia")

## Programming Questions
# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Chapter 5 also introduces several important R extensions, or packages. Use the "install.packages()" function to install the "wordcloud" package.'
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("wordcloud")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'install.packages("wordcloud")')
  
# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now call the "library()" function to load the "wordcloud" package.'
  CorrectAnswer: library(wordcloud)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(wordcloud)', 'library("wordcloud")')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

- Class: text 
  Output: 'We will use the "wordcloud" package to visualize a document-term matrix called "dtm", which has already been loaded for you.'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the "inspect()" function to visualize the first 5 rows and 8 columns of "dtm".'
  CorrectAnswer: inspect(dtm[1:5, 1:8])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='inspect(dtm[1:5, 1:8]')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Currently, "dtm" belongs to a special R class called "DocumentTermMatrix". This object class is not easily manipulated in R. Using the as.matrix() function, coerce "dtm" to a matrix object in R called "dtm.mat".'
  CorrectAnswer: dtm.mat <- as.matrix(dtm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dtm.mat <- as.matrix(dtm)")
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Finally, use the wordcloud() function to visualize the information contained in the eighth document of "dtm.mat" only.'
  CorrectAnswer: wordcloud(colnames(dtm.mat), dtm.mat[8, ])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'wordcloud(colnames(dtm.mat), dtm.mat[8, ])')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.
