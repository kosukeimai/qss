# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'True or False: Loops can simplify our programming code when we want to repeatedly execute code chunks over and over again.'
  AnswerChoices: '"True"; "False"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'True'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"True"')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'To iterate means to _____.'
  AnswerChoices: 'perform repeatedly; perform once; skip over'
  CorrectAnswer: perform repeatedly
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='perform repeatedly')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 3
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Given that "n <- 10", how many times will the loop "for (i in 1:n)" iterate through?'
  CorrectAnswer: '10'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='10')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In the conditional expression "if (Y) {expression1}", "expression1" will be executed if "Y" is _____.'
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: 'True'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  Hint: See 'General Conditional Statements in R' 

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'A conditional statement that is nested within a loop is executed _____ the loop.'
  AnswerChoices: 'inside; outside'
  CorrectAnswer: inside
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='inside')
  Hint: See 'General Conditional Statements in R' 

## Programming Questions
- Class: text
  Output: 'It is often useful to create an empty vector to store the computational output from a loop'

# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Create a vector called "output" that is filled with "NA"s and has the length "n". The object "n" has been included in this lesson.'
  CorrectAnswer: output <- rep(NA, n)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='output <- rep(NA,n)')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the "cat()" function to put together a phrase and the object "n". The final output should read ''The object n has length 10''.'
  CorrectAnswer: cat("The object n has length", n)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cat("The object n has length", n)')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'A vector called "fruit" has been loaded for you. Call the vector to see what it looks like.'
  CorrectAnswer: fruit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fruit')

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use a function to determine the different types of fruit (we want to see each fruit listed once).' 
  CorrectAnswer: unique(fruit)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='unique(fruit)')
  Hint: See 'Poll Predictions'

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Here is a variant of the classic ''FizzBuzz'' coding question. Write a for loop that executes the code ''cat(''The following number i is divisible by 3'', i, ''\n'')'' for numbers from 1 to 50 (inclusive) only for the numbers divisible by 3. Include brackets for the conditional.'
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 1:50){if (i %% 3 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 3", i, "\n") }}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='for(i in 1:50){if (i %% 3 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 3", i, "\n") }}')
  Hint: See 'Loop in R' and 'General Conditional Statements in R'. The modulo operator is "%%".

# Question 11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Continuing from the previous FizzBuzz code you wrote, if the number is divisible by 5 (but not by 3), execute the code ''cat(''The following number i is divisible by 5'', i, ''\n'')''.'
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 1:50){if (i %% 3 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 3", i, "\n") } else if (i %% 5 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 5", i, "\n")}}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='for(i in 1:50){if (i %% 3 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 3", i, "\n") } else if (i %% 5 == 0) { cat("The following number i is divisible by 5", i, "\n")}}')
  Hint: The answer involves adding a single else if condition.
