# Question 1  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'True or False: A positive correlation means that one variable is more likely to be above its mean when the other variable is also above its mean.'
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: 'True'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  Hint: See 'Correlationa and Scatterplot'

# Question 2

  CorrectAnswer: '0'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='0')
  Hint: See 'Least squares'

# Question 3
