# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Which statement best describes how simple randomization differs from complete randomization?'
  AnswerChoices: 'Only part of our sample is randomly chosen; We randomize part of the sample but do not randomize the treatment; We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori; We randomize the sample, a priori'
  CorrectAnswer: 'We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We choose how much of the sample receives treatment a priori')
  Hint: See 7.1.1.

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Let variance and bias be denoted by V(x) and B(x) respectively. Then Mean Squared Error (MSE) equals:'
  AnswerChoices: 'V(x^2) + B(x); V(x) + B(x^2); V(x)^2 + B(x); V(x) + B(x)^2'
  CorrectAnswer: 'V(x) + B(x)^2'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='V(x) + B(x)^2')
  Hint: See 7.1.2.

# Question 3
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'The variance in a population is 5. For a sample of size 10 from that population, what is the variance in the sample mean (express your answer to the nearest 0.1)?'
  CorrectAnswer: '0.5'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.5')
  Hint: See 7.1.2. Use the Central Limit Theorem.

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In the context of confidence intervals, what is alpha?'
  AnswerChoices: 'The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter; The probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter, based on sample size; The probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter, regardless of sample size; The bias in the probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of a parameter'
  CorrectAnswer: 'The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The probability that over repeated sampling the confidence interval does not contain the true value of a parameter')
  Hint: See 7.1.2.

# Question 5
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'In our sample of voters we find that 70% of the participants support Obama. If we want our 95% confidence interval for the true population proportion to be within +/- 1% of the true value, what is the minimum number of participants we must ask?'
  CorrectAnswer: '8068'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='8068')
  Hint: See 7.1.3. How does margin of error allow us to determine the sample size given a predetermined level of significance?'

# Question 6
- Class:  mult_question
  Output: 'Retrospective bias corrected confidence intervals differ from the prospective bias corrected confindence intervals because:'
  AnswerChoices: 'Actually, both correction methods do not differ at all; In the prospective method the magnitude of the bias is estimated without observing the true parameter values; In practice the retrospective bias corrected confidence intervals have a lower coverage rate; In the prospective method more data points are needed in its estimation'
  CorrectAnswer: 'In the prospective method the magnitude of bias is estimated without observing the true parameter values'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='In the prospective method the magnitude of bias is estimated without observing the true parameter values')
  Hint: See 7.1.3.

# Question 7
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'How many degrees of freedom does a t-statistic require for a sample of size N?'
  AnswerChoices: 'n; n-1; n-2; sqrt(n)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='n-1')
  Hint: See 7.1.4.

# Question 8
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'I flip a fair coin 27 times. What is the variance in the expected number of heads (express to the nearest 0.001)?'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.009')
  Hint: See 7.1.2. What does the Central Limit Theorem say?

# Question 9
- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Now, I flip a coin of unknown bias 10 times. It comes up heads 8 times. What is the (non-negative) margin of error, calculated from a 95% confidence interval for the true probability the coin comes up heads (to the nearest 0.01)?'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.25')
  Hint: See 7.1.3.

# Question 10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'In a sample 50% of the times a coin has landed tails. For 95% confidence and a margin of error of 0.001, roughly how many flips should you we need to check if the coin is actually fair?'
  AnswerChoices: '100000; 500000; 1000000; 5000000'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1000000')
  Hint: See 7.1.3. What does this say about sample size?

# Question 11
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'The variance of a Bernoulli distributed random variable is given by: p(1-p). What is the value of p that maximizes the variance of such a variable?'
  AnswerChoices: '0; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/2')
  Hint: See 7.1.3.
